# PotHoler---Fix-it-Felix
A website that:
•
Allows the user to submit photos of potholes from which location data is taken.
•
Those who intend to fix the potholes (mender) can enter their location. The distance
between them and the nearest pothole is calculated.
•
After the potholes are fixed then the authority checks if the potholes are fixed and then
close the request.
